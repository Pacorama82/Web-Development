        <h1>What Are Web Applications?</h1>
        <p>
            Web applications are interactive software programs that run on web servers and are accessed through web browsers. Unlike traditional desktop applications, web apps do not require installation and can be used from any device with internet access. Examples include online banking, email services, and e-commerce platforms.

        <h2>How Web Applications Interact with Back-End Databases</h2>
        <p>
            Web applications often need to store, retrieve, and update data. This is achieved by connecting to back-end databases. When a user submits a form or requests information, the web app sends a request to the server. The server processes the request, interacts with the database (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB), and sends the results back to the user's browser. This process ensures data is stored securely and can be accessed or modified as needed.

        <h2>Business Use Cases: Intranet vs. Internet</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Intranet Use Case:</strong> A company’s internal HR portal allows employees to view payslips, request leave, and update personal information. This web application is only accessible within the organization’s private network.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Internet Use Case:</strong> An online retail store enables customers worldwide to browse products, place orders, and track shipments. This web application is accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
